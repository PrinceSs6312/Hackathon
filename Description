Rural Health During Prenatal Period:
India contributes to 15 per cent of the global maternal death toll.
About 44, 000 Indian women die each year due to complications arising during childbirth.
Over 80 per cent of maternal deaths in India are due to six medical causes, including haemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labour, sepsis, unsafe abortion and pre-existing conditions, such as anemia and malaria.
About 70 per cent of these can be prevented with regular monitoring of health during the maternity.
During pregnancy, a pregnant women is prone to Hypertension which increases the risk of health complications.
In urban areas, this is prevented by attending the regular prenatal appointments so that the doctor can monitor the blood pressure closely unlike the rural areas, where the women don’t have proper access to the hospitals as they have to commute long distances due to very few availability of gynaecologists in their surroundings.
It’s also difficult for a pregnant woman in the rural area to commute to the hospitals on a regular basis as many villages don’t have proper transport facilities and travelling regularly through public transport may affect their health especially in the third trimester.
