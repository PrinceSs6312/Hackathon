To overcome such problems that are being faced by pregnant women in the rural areas, we are using fit bands which is a wrist band which senses the heart rate and blood pressure of the patient.
The data collected from this device is stored in an application which can be monitored by the hospital which requires continuous monitoring of these data which is normally monitored by a medical transcriptionist (intermediate).
The transcriptionist will keep the doctor informed in case of an emergency and will take necessary actions to enhance the patient’s health during their maternity period.
By doing this the pregnant women don’t have to travel long distances and everything could be monitored while they are at their homes.
